### Steps to Complete the Code

1. **Arrange the Code Blocks:**

   - Place the code block that defines the Verilog module name, inputs, and outputs first.
   - Next, add the code block that defines the module functionality (the assign block).
   - Finally, add the code block that ends the module.

2. **Drag and Drop:**

   - Drag and drop the code blocks to arrange them in the order mentioned above for both the Verilog module and the testbench.

3. **Complete the Code Blocks:**

   - For the Verilog module:

     - Enter a name for the module. The name should begin with an alphabet and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`). No spaces or special characters allowed.
     - Select the inputs as `A` and `B`, and the output as `Y`.
     - In the assign block, assign `Y` the value of the required logic expression:
       - For AND logic: `Y = A & B;`
       - For OR logic: `Y = A | B;`
       - For NOR logic: `Y = ~(A | B);`
       - For NAND logic: `Y = ~(A & B);`
     - Use the blocking assignment operator (`=`) for combinational logic.

   - For the Verilog testbench:
     - Enter a name for the testbench. The name should begin with an alphabet, include only alphanumeric characters and underscores, and must not match the module name.
     - Declare `A` and `B` as registers, and `Y` as a wire.
     - Instantiate the logic gate module by entering its name and selecting the arguments in the same order as in the module definition.
     - Define the input `A` and `B` waveforms in the initial block.

**Note:**

- While naming modules, testbenches, variables, and instance names, ensure they begin with an alphabet or underscore and only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- Do not use the same name for any two variables in the same module or testbench.

### Observations

- After clicking the **Validate** button (assuming all code blocks are filled correctly), you should see a "Success" message and a truth table under the Observations section.
- Observe the input wave and the corresponding expected and observed output `Y`.
