# Design of Digital Circuits Using Verilog

## Components Required -

Choose appropriate components to view the corresponding observations

## Circuit Connections -

This Experiment does not require any connections to be made

## Observations -

- Click or tap on an element in the components bar to get that gate's Verilog and Corresponding Testbench code, which are displayed in the two columns in the workspace
- Please note that this workspace is not editable
- After getting the code in the two text areas click on validate
- Corresponding output can subsequently be viewed
